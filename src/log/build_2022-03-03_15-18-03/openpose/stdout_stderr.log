CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGlog.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Glog", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Glog" with any of
  the following names:

    GlogConfig.cmake
    glog-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Glog" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Glog_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Glog"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
