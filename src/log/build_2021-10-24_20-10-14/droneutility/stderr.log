CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findh264decoder.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "h264decoder", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "h264decoder" with
  any of the following names:

    h264decoderConfig.cmake
    h264decoder-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "h264decoder" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "h264decoder_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "h264decoder" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
