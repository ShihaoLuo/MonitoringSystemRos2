CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindGl.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Gl", but CMake did
  not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Gl" with any of
  the following names:

    GlConfig.cmake
    gl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Gl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Gl_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Gl" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
