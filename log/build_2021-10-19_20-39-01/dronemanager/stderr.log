CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindThread.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Thread", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Thread" with any
  of the following names:

    ThreadConfig.cmake
    thread-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Thread" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Thread_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Thread"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
