CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindFFMPEG.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "FFMPEG", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "FFMPEG" with any
  of the following names:

    FFMPEGConfig.cmake
    ffmpeg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "FFMPEG" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "FFMPEG_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "FFMPEG"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
